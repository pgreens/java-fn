Extensions for functional programming in Java

This is mainly a way to try out Github Actions

## Main Features

- Tuples
- Immutable List, interface and functions

## ImList

- why?
- Java's interface is mutable by nature
- You don't know which implementation you're using, so you have to assume it's mutable
- coding defensively involves lots of extra copies
- ListIterator??

- how?
